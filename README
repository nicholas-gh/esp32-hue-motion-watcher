This is a hacked up mixture of

https://github.com/imxieyi/esp32-i2c-ssd1306-oled/
https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git
https://github.com/pcbreflux/espressif

and I need to tidy up, fix up what is which license, and so on.

It's essentially a prototype. Now it does work, starts the task of
rearranging the code to some sense.
